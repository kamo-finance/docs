**What is a Yield Object (YO)?**

Yield Object (YO) embodies the yield component of an underlying yield-bearing asset. The yield from the underlying asset is continuously streamed to the holder of yield object until the market reaches maturity ,

**Implied APY**\
Implied APY serves as the market-driven "rate" at which YT is valued. If the realized Underlying APY surpasses the Implied APY rate paid, it results in a profit for the holder.

Thus, purchasing YT can effectively be viewed as betting on the yield performance of an asset
